# 1966 Ford Thunderbird Tail Lights Control

**Introduction:** This repository covers the design of simulates the sequential tail light operation of the 1966 Ford Thunderbird using 74HC74 logic.  This project was created in partial fulfillments of ENGR 354 "Digital Logic" at Walla Walla University. I worked with [Konrad McClure](https://github.com/KonradMcClure) to build the combinational logic circuit. For more information on the theory and circuit design, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/froeca/1966-Ford-Thunderbird-Tail-Lights-Control/wiki).

**Credits:** As mentioned previously, I completed this project with fellow ENGR 357 student, Konrad McClure. We also recived a lot of help from, [Dr. Curtis Nelson](https://gab.wallawalla.edu/~curt.nelson/), our professor. Design simulation was completed in [logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), a free educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.

**Status of My Project:** My project works perfectly using only 6 logic IC's from the 74HC74 logic series. If you'd like to simulate the project yourself, check out the [simulation files](https://github.com/froeca/1966-Ford-Thunderbird-Tail-Lights-Control/tree/master/Simulations) in the repository folder entitled "Simulations". 

**Contact Information:** I hope this information helps you learn more about combinational logic design. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me by email at: Caleb.Froelich@wallawalla.edu. All the best in your Digital Logic endeavors!
